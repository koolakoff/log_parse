A demo project of logs parser tool

contain 
- parse_lib.py - engine for parsing specified events
- parse_usb.py - an example of usage - a use case for tracking USB stick event detection from dmesg logs
- log_example_1_usb - the piece of dmesg report used as a log example


to use the engine, just need register set of Parser objects
each object shoudl represent it's own event that we want to track from logs
then feed the logs lines to the Parser objects and it will return the result_line if match event or None if not

there are 2 use cases
- track one line log. In scope of this use case it is possible to register
  -- regexp that would be chedked by logs parser engine automatically
     Example:
     parser_usb = Parser(r"usb.*Product:\ Mass\ Storage\ Device", result_line="USB detected")
  -- or external function handler for parsing some specific cases
      (i.e. when needs parse some info from log line)
     Example:
     def parse_hello(line):
        if "hello" in line: return "a Hello event"
     parser_usb = Parser(parse_hello)
- track multiple lines log. 
  some cases may be tracked in log with few lines.
  in this case it is possible to register the list of handlers (regex or external functions) 
  for each of line. The parser will print result only when each of lines from the set is catched
  Example:
     def parse_world(line):
        if "world" in line: return "a Hello world event"
     parser_usb = Parser([r"hello",parse_world])

Note, when passing a line as a regexp use letter r in front of string like this
r"some\ regexp\ line"
the 'r' tells python to store all '\' as a symbol of '\' but not as a hash-combo

Note, it is used re.VERBOSE regexp style
